## Error Log
The main aim of this task is that when errors occur, the log message will start with "ERROR:". The task is to write a Log Monitor, which scans the log file and generates a report with all errors. The order of the errors follows the same order as the log file. Used "-----" as the separator between different sessions. For each error, the report also includes at most the last 3 messages for the same session before that error.
